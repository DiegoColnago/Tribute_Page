        <p class="justifyed-text">Epictetus was
            Born a slave in 50 A.D. He lived in Rome and since younger ages acquired interest for philosophy.
            Freedom came to him somethime around 68 A.D.
            Afther been Banished from Rome by order of imperor Domitian, Epictetus went to Nicopolis, Greece, where
            he funded a philosophical school.</p>

        <p class="justifyed-text">All the knolege of Epictetus were put togheter by his pupils.
            We can say that his philosophy is based uppon that all the external events, that out of our control,
            must be accepted whitout passion. Otherwise we would be slaves os these events. Then, to be really free,
            we must take responsability of our own actions, the only thing that actually are under our control.
            Dead around 135 A.D, Epictetus lived his live in a very simple way, whith few possessions.

        <p>"Some things are in our control and others not. <br> Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire,
            aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. <br> Things not in our control are body, property,
            reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions."</p>

        <p>"We have no power over external things, and the good that ought to be the object of our <br> earnest pursuit,
            is to be found only within ourselves."</p>
